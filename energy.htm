<h1> Energy Upheavel.</h1>
<p>Our energy system is transforming over the past decade. The cost of solar power has plummeted due to economies of scale and improved technology the price of solar equipment has dropped by 89 percent since 2010. The  cost for wind power has plunged as well. Due to these decreases new solar and wind investments are usually cheaper than natural gas and coal investments.However , renewables still have one major setback Energy storage.  For utility scales systems renewables need a way to store excess energy from windy and sunny days for cloudy and calm days.

	<td> <li> <b><u>Renewable resources of  Energy: </u> </b> Researchers  are developing new methods to store large amounts of energy some examples include storing energy as heat in materials compressing air or turning air into a liquid although it remains to be seen which method is best. These solutions will certainly be implemented for large-scale utility in the future by 2050

	<td> <li><b><u>Fusion Power:</b></u> Currently  fusion power is purely speculative. However 35 nations are collaborating on a 20 billion dollar project in
France to test the feasibility of fusion for power generation. It   will work by creating a fusion powered plasma inside an experimental machine.  Walls of the machine will absorb the energy using it to produce steam that will generate electricity with turbines.
First plasma is planned for December 2025. By 2050 we could have fully functional fusion power plants operating more efficiently than any other power source in history.
