<h1> Biotechnology</h1>
<p>By 2050 our food consumption will be wildly different.Mostly due to meat livestock contributes to 15% of human greenhouse gas emissions and uses 26% of the Earth's terrestrial surface to feed our growing population.For lowering emissions we must move away from meat.Assisting with this, our meat alternatives companies like <i> beyond meat and impossible foods </i>have obtained billion dollar valuations supplying the rapidly growing meat alternatives market.

	<td> <li> <b><u>Food For Thought: </u> </b> Plant-based diets as a whole are growing in popularity. Cultured meat is meat produced by in vitro cell culture it avoids the slaughtering of animals and produces very minimal emissions. By 2050 we will likely have in vitro t-bone steaks produced for the masses to meet the demand.

<td> <li><b><u>Vertical Farming :</b></u> Farms will move indoors vertical and into cities the vertical farming market will be exploding by 2050.There  will be large-scale vertical farms all around the world/ feeding the growing population while using very little land and water as our food consumption transforms.

<tr>
<td> <li><b><u>Stem cell Technology :</b></u> Biotechnology  will advance, while prosthetics replace large organs, stem cells will regenerate injuries and diseases.  Stem  cells which can be guided into becoming a wide variety of specific cells will be used for therapies. Eventually like brain chips stem cell therapies could help those with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's but also those with type 1 diabetes heart disease burns cancer arthritis and all sorts of other diseases

<tr>
<td> <li><b><u>Gene Editing :</b></u> Gene editing using CRISPR / canine technology scientists can now remove strands of DNA that are causing illnesses and replace them with different ones. In  the future scientists hope to cure lifelong inherited diseases with this technology.
